# Assignment_2_Branching_Merging
We delve deep into the fundamental Git concepts of branching and merging, exploring how they facilitate collaborative coding while maintaining the integrity and stability of the codebase.
Branching: Creating isolated environments within the Git repository to develop features or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase.
Merging: Integrating changes from one branch into another, consolidating code changes while preserving history.
